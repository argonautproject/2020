# Argonaut 2020 Project Overview

## Intro
* For an intro to our 2020 project plan, see [this deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OgyYZOfXoP78T-lwiAbeCdlxRRSsNDB_ZCiPZGRFzvs/present)
* Recording is availabe <link to be provided after March 18 call>

## Projects

* **Bulk Data**. Enhance the FHIR Bulk Data API based on real-world experience, to be ready for regulatory requirements that come online in 2022.
* **Granular Controls.** Expand the SMART App Launch Framework to support finer-grained access controls.
* **Patient Lists.** Ensure that provider-facing apps can figure out things like "who are the patients I'm seeing today,"
  or "who are the patients I'm responsible for in the hospital right now," or "who are the patients in this ward."

## Meeting Schedule

We'll host two types of calls:
 * **Project-specific technical "Workgoup" calls every other week.** These are intended for small-group discussion of
   the evolving specifications, and we're encouraging folks to join these calls  only if you're actively contributing
   to the technical specifications. We'll keep detailed notes and provide routine status updates so everyone can keep tabs.
 * **Cross-project "Checkpoint" calls monthly**. These are community-wide update calls, intended for broader discussion
   including Q&A. We encourage broad attendance and will record calls to ensure that folks can catch up anytime.
